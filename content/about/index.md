This website is *very* much a WIP.

I want to make a website that contains resources that I found useful that made my life easier.

## Rules for Submitting Links

Eventually there will be infrastructure that will allow you to add links yourself. All links/resources must follow the following rules:

1. The resource must be helpful to the student. Any scam links, spam links, phishing/virus attempts and/or links that are otherwise harmful and/or irrelevant to the safety or learning of the student is not permitted. In other words, the link to the resource must be safe and beneficial.
2. The resource must be freely accessible to the public without any paywall requirement or any other requirement to view content. **Discord links are not permitted.**
3. The resource must not violate academic integrity policies at Carleton University. (see [Academic Integrity](https://carleton.ca/registrar/academic-integrity/#sect1)).
4. The resource may not violate any form of copyright. **Websites that publish previous lectures/assignments/work/exams without permission are not allowed.**

Rules are subject to change.
