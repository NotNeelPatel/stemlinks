<h1>About</h1>

<p>This website is <em>very</em> much a WIP.</p>
<p>I want to make a website that contains resources that I found useful that made my life easier. We should not gatekeep information. Education should be free.</p>
<h2 id="rules-for-submitting-links">Rules for Submitting Links</h2>
<p>Eventually there will be infrastructure that will allow you to add links yourself. All links/resources must follow the following rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>The resource must be helpful to the student. Any scam links, spam links, phishing/virus attempts and/or links that are otherwise harmful and/or irrelevant to the safety or learning of the student is not permitted. In other words, the link to the resource must be safe and beneficial.</li>
<li>The resource must be freely accessible to the public without any paywall requirement or any other requirement to view content. <strong>Discord links are not permitted.</strong></li>
<li>The resource must not violate academic integrity policies at Carleton University. (see <a href="https://carleton.ca/registrar/academic-integrity/#sect1">Academic Integrity</a>).</li>
<li>The resource may not violate any form of copyright. <strong>Websites that publish previous lectures/assignments/work/exams without permission are not allowed.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Rules are subject to change.</p>
